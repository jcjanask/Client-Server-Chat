# Client-Server-Chat
A two way communication between a server and one client with a GUI for both server and client

Make sure you enter a port number above 1024, if port number is not an available port, or not a viable integer, the program will crash.
Hostname aka IP number can be "localhost", 127.0.0.1, or whatever the server's IP is. 
Must run ChatBoxServer and ChatBoxClient separately, and must press "connect" on the server messenger first, than you can connect with the client.
